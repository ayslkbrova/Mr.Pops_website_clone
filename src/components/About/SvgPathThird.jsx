                After the festivals in Dnipro, we went to Kyiv. There we started looking for partners, but we wanted special ones. They became the coffee shops of the third wave. Then they were joined by eco-markets, delicatessen shops, delicatessen chains.

              <p>Now we have representative offices in Kyiv, Dnipro, Odesa (and before the war - in Kharkiv)</p>
